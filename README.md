# lingress
The lingress project is to develop the pipeline to analyse the Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) dataset using a univariate linear regression model. This package contains the analysis with linear regression (OLS) and visualises the interpretation of the results with a p-value of all NMR peaks.
